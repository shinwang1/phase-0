6.Maintenance

# What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?

The primary goal of my site is to tell the world who I am and why I do what I do. I will be contributing to my own blog and projects. My audience will also be able to see my professional history and have a way to get in contact with me.

# What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?

I think my target audience will likely be searching for tips and know how's on their journey to learn web development. I will try to document my own path so that whoever views it can have a sense of how I got to where I am.

# What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.

At this point, I want to let the users know that they have access to certain information about me by the main categories. The primary action is to verify who I am and know that they've found me. I can probably do this by a picture of my face, name, and Linkedin profile link.

# What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?

The main things that I think people should know is the difference between UX and UI. The metaphor that I've learned is from horse riding. User Interaction (UI) is what you control while riding: i.e. the reins, whip, and stirrup. In web design, this is the buttons, the scrolling, and dropdown menu, etc. User experience (UX) is how you feel riding the horse.

# What is user experience design and why is it valuable?

User experience design is study, evaluation of how users feel about a given system whether it be mobile app, web app, or desktop software. It's valuable because it emphasize the design process around the users. If users are not the focus of design, then, as designers, we will make many false assumptions about what the user will experience. If we don't care to get feedback about the friction of our design, then our application may be difficult to use - rendering itself useless.

# Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?

I think good design and bad design is not a constant. Even now, design is something that will constantly evolve with the additions of new systems into our technological ecosystem. I don't think this challenge is tedious; however, the concepts to take away may not be apparent to all.
