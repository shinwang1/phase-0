# Wireframe Reflections

# What is a wireframe?

A wireframe is a quick mockup of a web/mobile layout at low fidelity. It's done to get a visual sense of the what and where of content.

# What are the benefits of wireframing?

It doesn't take a long time to do - meaning that several iterations can be done and compared to one another to flush out ideas and the intent of the site.

With the tools that we have, almost anyone can do it. This creates an environment of a lot of ideas without costing a lot of resources.


# Did you enjoy wireframing your site?

I enjoyed it. I had a lot of ideas on paper and couldn't decide what to put down. Then I just started making one because I knew it'll be iterated several times, so the process became easier.

# Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea?

I asked a few people of what they thought and took quick feedbacks.

# What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?

I searched "cool design blogs" in Google and looked at the possibilities. I didn't know why the blog page has to be different from my main index page. I think with modern websites, certain headers or even layouts don't have to change. If we're going to use dynamic scrolling and search, then we probably don't have to separate the two. I'm 100% on this, but will flush out with research.

# Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy and which parts did you find tedious?

I enjoyed the whole process. I'm looking forward to making more.
