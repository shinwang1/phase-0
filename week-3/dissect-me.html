			What are the benefits of version control?

			1. It allows collaboration between individuals of a team since different versions of the same file will eventually be merged. 2. It keeps track of the differences between files saved over time, so that one can revert to previous versions if necessary. 3. It allow a master to stay intact without fear of losing it.

			How does git help you keep track of changes?

			1. Git allows the user to provide detail comments on their commits while working in branches other than the master. Agreement to this workflow between individuals of a team creates an assurance that people are working towards a common goal.

			Why use GitHub to store your code?

			Things can happen (destroy) to personal and work computer harddrives. Having a remote repository provides the redundancy in the work that's done.

	What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?
	
	With my pair, we used the <section>, <aside>, and <article> semantic tags for this exercise. With the knowledge that semantic tags make the HTML more legible, I will continue with it as good practice. I also think we're going to benefit from using it along with the CSS practice this week. Before HTML 5, <div> tags were used for everything. Now, the general layout can be quickly defined with the semantic tags.

	How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?

	Elements are laid out on the page with senamtic tags along with other HTML tags. The order of how the browser uses to display elements can be found in the following:

	What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?

	Sublime has a neat feature that allows its user to add Snippets for quick coding short-hands. I will definitly use it to add my own snippets. For example, it'll be handy to have one for Bootstrap when I'm implementing the link. Another one would be jQuery. I will search to see if these already exist.
