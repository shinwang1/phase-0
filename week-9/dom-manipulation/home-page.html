<!-- Add your reflection here -->
<!-- What did you learn about the DOM?
I can use Javascript to manipulate the nodes (tags) inside html to create cool effects.

What are some useful methods to use to manipulate the DOM?
I think they're all pretty cool once you start to use them. I will have to
use them in my future projects to see their usefulness. -->
